            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Baby Activity Planner. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you about how we look after your personal data when you use our mobile application and tell you about your privacy rights.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We are committed to minimal data collection and maximum privacy. Here's what you should know about our data practices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We use Mixpanel analytics software solely to count the total number of users. This is the only data that leaves your device. The analytics data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify individual users.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All app data, including child age settings, play suggestions, and app preferences, is stored exclusively on your device. We do not have access to this information, and it never leaves your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Calendar Integration:</strong> When you save play suggestions to your calendar, this is done directly through your device's calendar app. We do not have access to your calendar data, and calendar events are stored locally on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information. We don't require accounts, email addresses, or any other personal information to use the app.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Our app uses the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mixpanel Analytics:</strong> We use Mixpanel analytics software to count the total number of users. This is the only data transmitted from your device. The analytics data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify individual users.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Our data usage is minimal and transparent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Mixpanel analytics software solely to count the total number of users. This helps us understand how many people are using the app, but we cannot identify individual users from this data.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> All data stored on your device is used only to provide the app's core functionality. This includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Storing child age settings</li>
                        <li>Generating play suggestions based on your settings</li>
                        <li>Storing your app preferences</li>
                        <li>Maintaining your local app data</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Calendar Integration:</strong> When you choose to save a play suggestion to your calendar, the app uses your device's calendar integration. Calendar events are created and stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your calendar data.</li>
                <li><strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> We do not share any data with third parties, except for anonymized total user count data sent to Mixpanel for analytics purposes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
